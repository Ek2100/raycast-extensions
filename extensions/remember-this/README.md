# Remember This

Remember This is an app designed to help you stay motivated and focused on completing your work by its due date. Simply enter any information, such as tasks, notes, or reminders, and set a due date. After the due date passes, the app automatically forgets the information, creating a sense of urgency to complete the task before it's lost forever. This unique feature inspires you to work efficiently and stay on top of your deadlines. With Remember This, you can say goodbye to forgotten tasks and missed deadlines, and hello to increased productivity.

## Usage

To use Remember This, simply open Raycast and type `Remember This` in the Raycast bar. This will open the Remember This interface, where you can enter any information you want to remember, along with a due date. After the due date passes, the information will be automatically deleted from the app, creating a sense of urgency to complete the task before it's lost forever.

You can also view Remembered Items by typing `Remembered Things` in the Raycast bar. From here, you can view items being remembered, their expirey and also delete them using `âŒ˜+delete`!
